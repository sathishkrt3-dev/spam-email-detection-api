It uses natural language processing techniques and a trained classification model to predict whether an incoming message is spam

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Classifies email text into **Spam** or **Ham**
- 🤖 Uses Machine Learning / NLP techniques (TF-IDF, Naive Bayes, etc.)
- 🌐 REST API built with Python (FastAPI / Flask)
- 📦 Easy to deploy and integrate with any app
- 🛡️ Secure and scalable

## 🧠 Model Details

- **Vectorizer:** TF-IDF
- **Algorithm:** Multinomial Naive Bayes (or whichever you used)
